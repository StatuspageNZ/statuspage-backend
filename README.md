#### The status page for your suburb

In 2020 we suffer from information overload and face a community transmission of fake news. _1 in 3 people don't know where to get official stats._

#### Information is power!

_Check On_ delivers a calm, actionable single source of truth for you and your suburb. It is a dynamic status page aggregating qualitative information from over 20 public agency and private institution data sources.

It is easy to tell when things are going well. When they aren't we direct you to the source of information. We integrate state-of-the-art and industry-leading Machine Learning to prioritise essential information

### Getting Up & Running

#### Requirements
- Docker
- NodeJS

#### Commands

In the root folder, run:

```
docker-compose up -d
cd src

If you have a local MongoDB running, this will not work. If you're on a macOS system, run: `$ sudo service mongod stop`
